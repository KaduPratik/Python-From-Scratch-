❤️ DAY 2 of Learning Python 🐍
🔀 Conditional Statements in Python

Welcome to Day 2 of my Python learning journey! 🚀

Today, I learned about Conditional Statements in Python. Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on whether a condition is True or False.

🧠 What I Learned Today
if statement
elif statement
else statement
Comparison using ==
Taking user input with input()
Converting user input into a decision
Using .lower() to handle different text cases
Handling invalid choices
Understanding how conditions control program flow
1. 🔹 if Statement

The if statement executes a block of code when a condition is True.

if condition:
    # code to execute

Example:

answer = input("Did you come on time? ")

if answer.lower() == "yes":
    print("We will start on time")
💡 Why use .lower()?

The .lower() method converts text into lowercase.

For example:

YES → yes
Yes → yes
YES → yes
yes → yes

Therefore, the condition:

answer.lower() == "yes"

can handle different ways of entering "yes".

2. 🔹 if and else

The else block executes when the if condition is False.

answer = input("Did you come on time? ")

if answer.lower() == "yes":
    print("We will start on time")
else:
    print("We will be late")
🔄 Program Flow
             User Input
                 ↓
        Is answer "yes"?
           ↙         ↘
        YES           NO
         ↓             ↓
 Start on time    We will be late
3. 🔹 Using if, elif, and else

When there are multiple possible conditions, we can use elif.

answer = input(
    "Did you come on time?\n"
    "Enter 1 for 'Yes' or 2 for 'No': "
)

if answer == "1":
    print("Since you said Yes")
    print("We will start on time")

elif answer == "2":
    print("Since you said No")
    print("We will be late")

else:
    print("Invalid choice")
🧠 How it works

The program checks the conditions from top to bottom:

if answer == "1"
        ↓
      True? ──→ Yes → Start on time
        ↓ No
elif answer == "2"
        ↓
      True? ──→ Yes → We will be late
        ↓ No
      else
        ↓
  Invalid choice
4. 🧪 Example Outputs
When the user enters 1
Did you come on time?
Enter 1 for 'Yes' or 2 for 'No': 1

Since you said Yes
We will start on time
When the user enters 2
Did you come on time?
Enter 1 for 'Yes' or 2 for 'No': 2

Since you said No
We will be late
When the user enters an invalid choice
Did you come on time?
Enter 1 for 'Yes' or 2 for 'No': 5

Invalid choice
📚 Key Difference
Statement	Purpose
if	Checks the first condition
elif	Checks another condition if the previous one is false
else	Executes when none of the conditions are true
📝 Important Note

Initially, I tried:

if(answer == 'Yes', lower() == 'yes'):

This does not work because .lower() needs to be called on the string variable.

The correct approach is:

if answer.lower() == "yes":

This was a good learning point about string methods and conditional statements.

🚀 Day 2 Summary

Today I learned how Python can make decisions based on conditions.

I practiced:

if → Check a condition
elif → Check another condition
else → Handle everything else

🐍 Learning Python one concept at a time.
